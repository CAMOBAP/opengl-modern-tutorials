Under Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux, you need to install the following
packages:

  apt-get install build-essential \
    libgl1-mesa-dev libglew1.5-dev freeglut3-dev \
    libglm-dev

To compile an example, go to its directly and just type:

  cd tut01/
  make

It will create an executable (such as 'triangle', 'cube' or 'teapot')
that you can run:

  ./triangle

You can compile all examples in one go by calling "make" in the top level
directory.
